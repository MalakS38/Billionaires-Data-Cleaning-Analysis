# Billionaires-Data-Cleaning-Analysis

This repository demonstrates a full workflow of **data cleaning, preparation, and analysis** using a dataset of global billionaires. 
The project covers removing duplicates, formatting text, descriptive statistics, pivot tables, and interactive charts for quick insights.

## Dataset

- **Raw Data**: `Billionaires Statistics Dataset Raw.xlsx`  
  Contains the original dataset including rank, category, personal information, net worth, country metrics, and more.

- **Cleaned Data**: `billionaires_cleaned.xlsx`  
  Includes processed data with duplicates removed, standardized formatting, and ready for analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Create backups
   - Remove duplicates
   - Standardize text formatting
   - Ensure numerical fields are properly formatted for analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, etc.)
   - Pivot tables with slicer to filter and analyze billionaires by category.  
   - Key insights show the **top 10 billionaires**, along with age ranges and number of billionaires in each range, visualized with a dynamic chart linked to the pivot table, which updates automatically when the category slicer is used
